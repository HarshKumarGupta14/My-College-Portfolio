    <p class="para">Hello friends. I'm a student from Bihar who is currently pursuing <strong>B.E. Computer Science And Engineering</strong> in <i>"Dhanalakshmi Srinivasan Engineering College"</i>.
      My college is located in <i>"Perambalur"</i> district of <strong>Tamil Nadu</strong>.<br />
      As an other state student, I wanna share my experience with you.. <br /><br />
      Being in this College for a long time, life brought unique challenges and opportunities. Being far from home pushed me to step out of my comfort zone, build new support systems, and adapt to a different cultural and social environment. This experience has made me more independent, resilient, and open to diverse perspectives, all of which have enriched both my academic and personal growth. <br /><br/>
      Being an out-of-state student has been one of the most transformative aspects of my college experience. Leaving the familiarity of my home state to pursue education in a completely new environment taught me how to adapt quickly, be resourceful, and embrace independence. At first, I faced homesickness, language problems and cultural differences, but over time, these challenges became opportunities for growth. I developed stronger communication skills by connecting with people from different backgrounds and learned to manage my time and responsibilities.

      Moving across state lines for college was never easy, but it’s been the most rewarding adventure of my life.
      I’ve learned, grown, and found a second home here. <br />
